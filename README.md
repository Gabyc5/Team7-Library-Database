# File SetUp 
Our files are structured by front-end and back-end. We have a front-end directory that holds all the HTML, CSS, and JS files relevant to the front-end. We then have a server folder that contains our server.js file that handles the routing of back-end requests. Within the server folder is also a routes directory that contains all the handlers for specific pages/tabs within the front-end. These js files have multiple functions that are referenced in the server.js file when handling routes.
